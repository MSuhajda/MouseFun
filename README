This is an experiment with NodeJS and Socket.io.

It is not a real game, not yet at least. You see other connected players' cursor in real-time, you can move it around that's all!

Required modules:
  - NodeJS
  - Socket.io (latest)


To run, edit the .html file and change socket.connect() to your server's IP address and port.
To edit the port, change line 53 on server.js.


Note:
	Only 1 connection/IP is allowed. You can disable that in server.js if you wish.
